Earth's climate has changed throughout history.<br>
 Just in the last <b> 650,000 years </b> there have <br>
been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat,<br> 
with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years<br>
ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of <br>
human civilization. Most of these climate changes are<br>
attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that<br>
change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.

 Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures<br>
 will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due<br>
 to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The<br>
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which<br>
 includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United<br>
 States and other countries,<b>forecasts a temperature rise<br>
 of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.</b><br>
